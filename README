ffmpeg-fas requires CMake to build.
http://cmake.org

================
1. DEPENDENCIES:
ffmpeg - ffmpeg.org
Most Linux setups should have ffmpeg installed.  To build this library, 
you'll need the ffmpeg "dev" (or header) package installed as well.
In Ubuntu, this is split into libavdevice-dev, libavutil-dev,
libavcodec-dev, libavformat-dev and libswscale-dev.
Other distros may use names such as "ffmpeg-dev" or "libav-dev".

On Windows, you'll need the FFMPEG Dev builds at 
http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/ .

======================
2. BUILDING FFMPEG-FAS:

LINUX:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..

WINDOWS:
(using cmake gui)
build dir: fas-root/build
source dir: fas-root
where fas-root is this folder.
Note: You'll need to set the variable FFMPEG_ROOT to point to
the folder with FFMPEG installed.


To generate MSVC project files, you can use cmake-gui and select your version 
of MSVC, or use cmake .. -G <generator>.
Use cmake --help to determine the correct generator.

Install routines are not yet implemented.
